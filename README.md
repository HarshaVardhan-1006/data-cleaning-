# Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to prepare it for analysis. The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, 
including details such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and more.

# Tools Used
Python: Data manipulation and cleaning using the pandas library.
Excel: Initial data inspection and manual verification.

# Data Cleaning Steps
Handling Missing Values:

Identified missing values using .isnull() in pandas.

Removed rows with missing critical information.

Filled missing values in non-critical columns with appropriate placeholders or default values.

Removing Duplicates:

Used .drop_duplicates() to eliminate duplicate records based on the 'title' ,'cast' and 'type' columns.

Standardizing Text Values:

Converted text data to lowercase to ensure consistency.

Stripped leading and trailing whitespaces.

Standardized country names and other categorical variables.

Converting Date Formats:

Transformed the 'date_added' column to a consistent datetime format (dd-mm-yyyy) using pd.to_datetime().

Renaming Column Headers:

Renamed columns to be lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores for uniformity.

Checking and Fixing Data Types:

Ensured 'release_year' is of integer type.

Verified that 'date' is in datetime format.

Checked and corrected data types for all other columns as necessary.

# Summary of Changes
Cleaned dataset with no missing critical values.

Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

Standardized text fields for consistency.

Uniform date formats across the dataset.

Consistent and clean column headers.
